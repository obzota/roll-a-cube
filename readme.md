Roll a Cube !
=============

This is my first unity project, it's still a work-in-progress.
Please be gentle with the code review. :)

Concept
-------

The idea of that mini-game is to make the cube colored faces match the colored obstacles and projectiles.
For example if you want to step on a red tile, you have to make the cube bottom red. If you want to parry a red bullet, you have to make the cube take the impact on the red side.


TODO List
---------

* ~~Make the cube actually roll~~
* Introduce a game manager to spawn the player
* Introduce a level generator
* Introduce some cannons to spawn bullets


What I already learned
----------------------

### About Unity animator manager

I implemented the cube rotation with Unity animation editor. I thought it would be easy with  the root motion functionnality to move my cube around.

But.

The animator is made for humano√Øde characters. So it won't provide an easy way to handle the cube rotation. Instead I had to create a huge state machine containing many similar animations and transitions. It takes a huge effort to setup every component of this state machine through the UI of Unity.

Given the symetry of the cube, I managed to reduce by half the size of state machine. However Unity still make some movement glitchy as the cube flips on certain transitions.

So this solution is clearly unadequate. A bit of scripting should greatly reduce the time spend on this kind of functionnality.

The time spend learning the animator was still worth it ! :)
